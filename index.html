      <p>I was born in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a></strong>, my parents are from 
      <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos">Laos</a></strong>. When I was 4, we had to fly away
      and we arrived in France. Where I was raised for the next 34 years. I got my
      Associate degree in Computer Science and work as an Analyst-Programmer for 9 years.
      I was programming in Cobol. I moved to North Carolina 11 years ago, and didn't do any programming
      related work for the next 8 years. I only got back at programming since 2017.
      My hobby are my families, I'm married and have 3 children. I also play
